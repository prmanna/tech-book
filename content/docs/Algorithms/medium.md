# Medium Complexity
---

* Number Swapper: Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary variables).
Hints - with just addition/substruction arithmatic, XOR.

* Tic Tac Win: Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe.

## Hashing

* Two Sum: Find a pair in array whose sum equals to the target
  input: [10,4,1,3,2] Target: 7 Output: [4,3]

  *Hint* - insert in hash and then start searching from first element, find the difference with the target and find the hash. 

* Logest consecutive sequence: find length of longest consecutive sequence from given array
  input: [10, 4, 20, 1,3,2] Output: [1,2,3,4]

## Sliding Window

* Two Sum: find a pair whose sum is equal to target

  input: [10,4,1,3,2] Target: 7 Output: [4,3]

  *Hint* - sort, start from bengining and end at the same time

* Traping Water: Given an arrary of height of bars (width = 1) calculate the amount of water trapped. 

  input: 5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3 Output = 5

  *Hint* -  use sliding window.
