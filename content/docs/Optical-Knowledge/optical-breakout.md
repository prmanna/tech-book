# Intro
There are two types of optics, grey and colored. In the grey optics, it has specific wavelength based on the pluggable types and they are used for short distances, while colored optics are designed for longer distance and it has more control on the frequency/wave-length configuration. 
In general, grey optics are used in router interface. This section covers mostly on Grey Optics.
