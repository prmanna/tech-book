What distinguishes TCP from other networking protocols is that it guarantees 100% transmission. This means that if you send 100kb of data from one computer to another using TCP, all 100kb will make it to the other side. This property of TCP is very powerful and is the reason that many network applications we use, such as the web and email are built on top of it.</description></item></channel></rss>
