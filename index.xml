Now let me introduce the companion spell Breadth First Search (BFS). The names are self-explanatory. While depth first search reaches for depth (child nodes) first before breadth (nodes in the same level/depth), breadth first search visits all nodes in a level before starting to visit the next level.</description></item><item><title>C++ Tips</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/programming-tips/c++/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/programming-tips/c++/</guid><description>Easy Complexity # Array # An array in C++ holds a fixed number of elements of a single type in contiguous memory locations.

From the answers we were given to our clarifying questions (see Prompt Box), we&amp;rsquo;re building a system that involves repeatedly (in the order of thousands of times per day) building and deploying code to hundreds of thousands of machines spread out across 5-10 regions around the world.</description></item><item><title>Design A Stock-Broker System</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/stock-broker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/stock-broker/</guid><description>1. Gathering System Requirements # As with any systems design interview question, the first thing that we want to do is to gather system requirements; we need to figure out what system we&amp;rsquo;re building exactly.
We&amp;rsquo;re building a stock-brokerage platform like Robinhood that functions as the intermediary between end-customers and some central stock exchange. The idea is that the central stock exchange is the platform that actually executes stock trades, whereas the stockbroker is just the platform that customers talk to when they want to place a trade&amp;ndash;the stock brokerage is &amp;ldquo;simpler&amp;rdquo; and more &amp;ldquo;human-readable&amp;rdquo;, so to speak.</description></item><item><title>Design Amazon</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/design-amazon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/design-amazon/</guid><description>1.

Per-flow load balancing can ensure the packet sequence and ensure that the same data flow is forwarded according to the routing entry with the same next hop and different data flows are forwarded according to routing entries with different next hops.
When multiple routes are installed in the routing table, a hash is used to determine which path a packet follows.</description></item><item><title>Google Drive - Design</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/google-drive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/google-drive/</guid><description>1.

We&amp;rsquo;re designing the core user flow of the Google Drive web application. This consists of storing two main entities: folders and files. More specifically, the system should allow users to create folders, upload and download files, and rename and move entities once they&amp;rsquo;re stored.</description></item><item><title>IP Precedence And TOS | DSCP</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/ip-tos-dscp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/ip-tos-dscp/</guid><description>Intro # 8 Bits of Type of Service in IP Header.

With parallel links being replaced by a single virtual link, STP detects no loops and all the physical links can be fully utilized.
I was also told that link aggregation makes your bridged network more stable. Every link state change triggers a Topology Change Notification in spanning tree, potentially sending a large part of your network through the STP listening-learning-forwarding state diagram.</description></item><item><title>QoS</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/qos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/qos/</guid><description>Intro # Traffic Shaping # The traffic shapers that we will look at here are commonly called token bucket shapers and are based on a token bucket algorithm which we will see can serve multiple purposes in achieving network QoS. We should note that frequently in networking literature such algorithms were also referred to as leaky bucket algorithms. In all but one case, that we will not be discussing here, these algorithms produce the same results.</description></item><item><title>Spine-leaf Architecture Basics</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/spine-leaf-arch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/spine-leaf-arch/</guid><description>Intro # What Is Spine-leaf Architecture? # The spine-leaf architecture consists of only two layers of switches: spine and leaf switches. The spine layer consists of switches that perform routing and work as the core of the network. The leaf layer involves access switches that connect to servers, storage devices, and other end-users. This structure helps data center networks reduce hop count and reduce network latency.
In the spine-leaf architecture, each leaf switch is connected to each spine switch.</description></item><item><title>TCP Congestion Control</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/tcp-congestion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/tcp-congestion/</guid><description>Intro # TCP is a protocol that is used to transmit information from one computer on the internet to another, and is the protocol I’ll be focused on in this post. What distinguishes TCP from other networking protocols is that it guarantees 100% transmission. This means that if you send 100kb of data from one computer to another using TCP, all 100kb will make it to the other side. This property of TCP is very powerful and is the reason that many network applications we use, such as the web and email are built on top of it.</description></item><item><title>First Blog</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/posts/2022-01-18-first-doc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/posts/2022-01-18-first-doc/</guid><description>Preface # This is my black board for my future technical book.
