Now let me introduce the companion spell Breadth First Search (BFS). The names are self-explanatory. While depth first search reaches for depth (child nodes) first before breadth (nodes in the same level/depth), breadth first search visits all nodes in a level before starting to visit the next level.</description></item><item><title>C++ Tips</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/programming-tips/c++/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/programming-tips/c++/</guid><description>C++ Tips # Templates # A template is a simple yet very powerful tool in C++. The simple idea is to pass the data type as a parameter so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for different data types. For example, a software company may need to sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass the datatype as a parameter.</description></item><item><title>Depth First Search</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/algorithms/depth-first-search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/algorithms/depth-first-search/</guid><description>Depth First Search # Intro # The pre-order traversal of a tree is DFS.

Priority Queue # A priority queue is a data structure that consists of a collection of items and supports the following operations:
insert: insert an item with a key. delete_min/delete_max: remove the item with the smallest/largest key and return it. Note that
we only allow getting and deleting the element with the min/max key and NOT any arbitrary key.</description></item><item><title>Two Pointers &amp; Sliding Window</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/algorithms/two-pointers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/algorithms/two-pointers/</guid><description>Two Pointers # Valid Palindrome # Determine whether a string is a palindrome, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case.

Gathering System Requirements # As with any systems design interview question, the first thing that we want to do is to gather system requirements; we need to figure out what system we&amp;rsquo;re building exactly.
From the answers we were given to our clarifying questions (see Prompt Box), we&amp;rsquo;re building a system that involves repeatedly (in the order of thousands of times per day) building and deploying code to hundreds of thousands of machines spread out across 5-10 regions around the world.</description></item><item><title>Design A Stock-Broker System</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/stock-broker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/stock-broker/</guid><description>1. Gathering System Requirements # As with any systems design interview question, the first thing that we want to do is to gather system requirements; we need to figure out what system we&amp;rsquo;re building exactly.
We&amp;rsquo;re building a stock-brokerage platform like Robinhood that functions as the intermediary between end-customers and some central stock exchange. The idea is that the central stock exchange is the platform that actually executes stock trades, whereas the stockbroker is just the platform that customers talk to when they want to place a trade&amp;ndash;the stock brokerage is &amp;ldquo;simpler&amp;rdquo; and more &amp;ldquo;human-readable&amp;rdquo;, so to speak.</description></item><item><title>Design Amazon</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/design-amazon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/design-amazon/</guid><description>1.

Per-flow load balancing can ensure the packet sequence and ensure that the same data flow is forwarded according to the routing entry with the same next hop and different data flows are forwarded according to routing entries with different next hops.
When multiple routes are installed in the routing table, a hash is used to determine which path a packet follows.</description></item><item><title>Google Drive - Design</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/google-drive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/systemdesign-tips/google-drive/</guid><description>1.

Unlike IPv4, fragmentation is not mandatory in IPv6, as all networks support an MTU of at least 1280 bytes.
Unlike IPv4, IPv6 relies on the source device instead of intermediary routers for fragmentation Unlike IPv4, an IPv6 router does not fragment a packet unless it is the packetâ€™s source.</description></item><item><title>IP Precedence And TOS | DSCP</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/ip-tos-dscp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/ip-tos-dscp/</guid><description>Intro # 8 Bits of Type of Service in IP Header.

The first version of this tool has been introduced 25 years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s relying on the TTL field of the ip-header, keep on incrementing starting on TTL as 1. Along the way, each router decreases the TTL by one, and when it hits zero, the router sends back an ICMP &amp;rsquo;time exceeded&amp;rsquo; message, revealing its identity.</description></item><item><title>Medium Complexity</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/algorithms/medium/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/algorithms/medium/</guid><description>Medium Complexity # Number Swapper: Write a function to swap a number in place (that is, without temporary variables).

With parallel links being replaced by a single virtual link, STP detects no loops and all the physical links can be fully utilized.
I was also told that link aggregation makes your bridged network more stable. Every link state change triggers a Topology Change Notification in spanning tree, potentially sending a large part of your network through the STP listening-learning-forwarding state diagram.</description></item><item><title>Network Virtualization in Cloud Data Centers</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/data-center/data-center-network-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/data-center/data-center-network-virtualization/</guid><description>Intro # Geographic Clusters of Data Centers # Data Center Interconnection (DCI) # Challenges of LAN Extension # TRILL # TRILL Architecture # TRILL Encapsulation Format # TRILL Features # GRE # GRE (Cont) # NVGRE # NVGRE (Cont) # NVO3 # NVO3 Terminology # NVO3 Terminology (Cont) # Current NVO Technologies # VXLAN # VXLAN Architecture # VXLAN Deployment Example # ![img|320x271](https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/diagrams/dc-virtualization/VXLAN Deployment Example.png)

We should note that frequently in networking literature such algorithms were also referred to as leaky bucket algorithms. In all but one case, that we will not be discussing here, these algorithms produce the same results.</description></item><item><title>Spine-leaf Architecture Basics</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/spine-leaf-arch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/spine-leaf-arch/</guid><description>Intro # What Is Spine-leaf Architecture? # The spine-leaf architecture consists of only two layers of switches: spine and leaf switches. The spine layer consists of switches that perform routing and work as the core of the network. The leaf layer involves access switches that connect to servers, storage devices, and other end-users. This structure helps data center networks reduce hop count and reduce network latency.
In the spine-leaf architecture, each leaf switch is connected to each spine switch.</description></item><item><title>TCP Congestion Control</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/tcp-congestion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/tcp-congestion/</guid><description>Intro # TCP is a protocol that is used to transmit information from one computer on the internet to another, and is the protocol Iâ€™ll be focused on in this post. What distinguishes TCP from other networking protocols is that it guarantees 100% transmission. This means that if you send 100kb of data from one computer to another using TCP, all 100kb will make it to the other side. This property of TCP is very powerful and is the reason that many network applications we use, such as the web and email are built on top of it.</description></item><item><title>TCP Data Transfer</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/tcp-data-transfer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/docs/networking-tips/tcp-data-transfer/</guid><description>Intro # TCP Connection Establishment Handshake # Sync The initiator that is establishing a connection with a target generates a random sequence number (5,045 for this example) and sends a TCP packet with its sync flag set to 1 and its sequenceNumber set to the just-defined sequence number. Sync/Ack Upon receipt of the TCP Sync packet from the initiator, the target sets its ack number value to the received sequenceNumber + 1 (5,046 in this example).</description></item><item><title>First Blog</title><link>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/posts/2022-01-18-first-doc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://prasenjitmanna.com/tech-book/posts/2022-01-18-first-doc/</guid><description>Preface # This is my black board for my future technical book.
